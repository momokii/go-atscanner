## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or higher
- API keys for each service you wish to use

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/momokii/go-atscanner.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd go-atscanner

# Build the project
go build -o go-atscanner.exe
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:

```
# Security Scanner API Keys
VIRUS_TOTAL_API_KEY=your_virustotal_api_key
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_abuseipdb_api_key
HYBRID_ANALYSIS_API_KEY=your_hybridanalysis_api_key
IPQS_API_KEY=your_ipqualityscore_api_key

# LLM API Key for AI-Powered Analysis (Optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## üìä Usage

### Prepare Target List

Create a CSV file in the `targets` directory with your targets with filename `targets.csv`:

```
example.com
192.168.1.1
44d88612fea8a8f36de82e1278abb02f
```

### Run the Scanner

```bash
# Run the application
./go-atscanner.exe
```

Follow the interactive prompts:

1. Select a security API to use (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, Hybrid Analysis, or IPQualityScore)
2. Choose whether to manually input your API key or use the one from your `.env` file
3. Decide if you want to use LLM-powered analysis for generating comprehensive reports
4. If you select LLM analysis, provide your OpenAI API key if not in the `.env` file

The scanner will process all targets from your CSV file and generate the appropriate reports.

### View Results

**CSV Results** (Raw Data):
- `results/results-virustotal.csv`
- `results/results-abuseipdb.csv`

- ScanType: Always "ip" for AbuseIPDB, categorizes the scan type
- ScanTime: Timestamp when scan was performed, important for temporal context

PUBLIC NETWORK INFORMATION
- IsPublic: Whether the IP is publicly routable (true/false)

- MD5: 128-bit hash, least secure but widely used for legacy systems

THREAT ASSESSMENT

NETWORK IDENTITY FIELDS
- CountryCode: Two-letter country code (US, ID, etc.), geographic origin can indicate risk

- Tor: Whether IP is a Tor exit node, commonly used for anonymous browsing

BEHAVIORAL INDICATORS
- BotStatus: Shows bot-like behavior, indicates automated activity vs human

## üß† LLM-Powered Analysis

Go-ATScanner now features AI-powered analysis of scan results. The tool can:

- Generate comprehensive security assessment reports for each scanner type
- Analyze and interpret technical data into actionable intelligence
- Provide structured, professional-grade security reports with:
  - Executive summary with clear threat level assessment
  - Detailed threat analysis with risk scoring
  - Key security indicators extracted from scan data
  - Technical details explaining findings
  - Actionable recommendations based on scan results

### Enabling LLM Analysis

To use the LLM analysis feature:

1. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

2. When running the scanner, select "yes" when prompted to use LLM for report generation
3. Reports are saved in the `results/reports` directory in both TXT and PDF formats:
   - `results/reports/report-virustotal.txt`
   - `results/reports/report-abuseipdb.txt`
   - `results/reports/report-hybridanalysis.txt`
   - `results/reports/report-ipqs.txt`

## üìù Future Enhancements

Future enhancements planned for this project:
- [ ] Interactive visualizations for scan results
- [ ] Automated threat correlation across multiple sources
- [ ] Expanded support for additional security APIs
- [ ] Custom report templates for different organizational needs
